Sails-Ember-Auth
================

Trying to have a good and fast base for Ember apps with a Sails API with authentication

Install
=======
You will nead node, sails, embe-cli for this project

    cd server
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    bower install
    
to start the sails server

    sails lift
    
to start the ember client

    ember serve

DONE
====

- Server side token auth with waterlock
- Sails-Ember-Blueprints to serve correct JSON
- friendlier login/logout urls
- API request from ember

TO DO
=====

- Fix Ember-Simple-Auth to make it work with waterlock


If you want to help feel free I'm kinda struggling with the limited number of documentation with sails with ember setups.
